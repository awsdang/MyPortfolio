Grasshopper: Some nodes I made
After finishing with Module 3 of BIMA+, I knew I had to futher deepen my knowledge in visual scripting, thus I decided to try Grasshopper 
I knew about it but never had the chance to use it, thus I have made several geometric scripts in Grasshopper and I am happy with the results
