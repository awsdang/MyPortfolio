The process I designed for the Showroom uses a modular system that is simple and focus on showing the Lighting product in the most elegant way possible.
My design consists of 2 modular pieces, a background frame that acts as the structural element for the display and a front panel that is easy to manufacture and cheap replace. This methon was a crucial solution for a problem the old showroom had, lighting fixtures were bolted into the old fixed display boards thus create an undesired look that can't be hidden.
