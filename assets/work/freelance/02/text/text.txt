The Corner Box
The Corner Box
A small family house yet very spacious. The concept behind the facade started from a box mass with specific materials; paint, stone and CNC machine metallic plates were used, to create this modern and unique design.
The client asked for a practical house where he can leverage all the space he has, the 10x10m layout was the best solution to the practicality the client asked.
