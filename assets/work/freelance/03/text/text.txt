House Redevelopment
House Redevelopment
I was hired by the client who just bought this house which needed a redesign for the elevation and also for interiors. The narrow plot and clients budget was the main factor for my decision to use simple elements and materials for the design of the facade.
I designed the interior for the main space of the project using light finishes and open plan system, in order to make the space feel more spacious furthermore, designing a kitchen that utilizes the maximum storage space possible.
