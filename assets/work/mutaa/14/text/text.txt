Commercial 222
As part of my work at Mutaa Al-Hashimi Architects, Building 222 consists of 4 storeies and a garage Basement on a plot area of 1000sqm of office, commercial use located in Hilla, Iraq
The interesting layout for this building which integrates a bank, hypermarket and small shops in the same building was a challenge.
