Building 227
As part of my work at Mutaa Al-Hashimi Architects, Building 227 consists of 7 storeies on a plot area of 300sqm of office use located in Baghdad, Iraq
The post-modern design for the building with its smooth glass gives it a unique look and interesting landmark in the city once it finish
