Mutaa Al-Hashimi
Villa 236
Villa 236
Villa 236 is located in Baghdad, Iraq with a plot area of 400sqm, the 1:4 plot area was very challenging, howerver I achieved to fit 5 en-suite bedrooms, total of 8 bathrooms it also features its interior waterfall and fountain as well as a panoramic lift.
What set this project apart of its modern facade of limestone featuring light metal columns. The open plan interior was originally used to overcome the narrow plot. however it become a strong selling point as the interior space for this project as the fountain, waterfall inside its interior courtyard, and the bridge that goes to the main bedroom, and the list goes on.
