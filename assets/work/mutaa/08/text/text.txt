Building 188
An Office Building I designed and produced the detailed drawings, one of my first project I worked under Mutaa Al-Hashimi Architects.
This project extended my Revit and Dynamo skills to ensure faster execution of drawings as well as gave me coordination experience as I was the true BIM coordinator for the project and coordinate with other disciplines to ensure as less clashes as possible
