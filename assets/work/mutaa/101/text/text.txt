Reception Chandelier
I designed this chandelier to fit the volume of the Reception, I designed it using Scripting methods for the concept mass. I have also designed the structure for it, I worked on the details to of the 1.5m diameter and 5.75m height chandelier.
This Chandelier was born to resemble the features and look of a round golden branch. The instant of a bright burst that was suspended into a fascinating lighting design. This chandelier can briefly outshine entire galaxies.
