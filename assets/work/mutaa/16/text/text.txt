Building 230
As part of my work at Mutaa Al-Hashimi Architects, Building 230 consists of four storey on a plot area of 400sqm of commercial use located in Hilla, Iraq
The post-modern design for the building emphasises the circular-shaped entrance to draw potential customers toward it to generate more revenue for the owners.
