Project 200
A House Renovation project, I was responsible for creating a new unique facade for this project with the least change possible. 
The visualized steps shows the change from the old facade to the new one shows. It shows how abstract the work is compared to how impactful the change was on the overall look of the facade and how much value it added to the house!
