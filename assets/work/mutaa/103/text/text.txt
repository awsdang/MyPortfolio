Guest House Chandelier
I designed a chandelier using Scripting methods for the concept mass. I have also designed and worked on the details to of the 5.5m lengh and 2.4m height chandelier.
I designed it to fit the volume of the guesthouse. The result is a modern expression of contemporary era techniques in a stunning chandelier. Composed of curved, organic lines. Chandelier frame is made of flexible and durable.
