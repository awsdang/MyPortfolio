Villa 234
As part of my work at Mutaa Al-Hashimi Architects, Villa 234 consists of two storey on a plot area of 600sqm located in Hilla, Iraq
The post modern design for the villa and the use of limestone, dark oak finish and the rose gold plated touches makes a luxurious looking Villa from the outside. The inside isn't less, the double volume reception area, large kitchen and courtyard completes the luxury the clients wanted
